# crowdstance-front
A sample frontend app that leverages the Crowdstance API (created on [Crowdhackathon #transport 2015](http://crowdhackathon.com/transport/)) to show real time public transit crowd-load percentage (currently mock percentages) in a given medium's route stops.

To use the first run the API server. See crowdstance-api README.md.
Then in your terminal run:

```shell
npm install;bower install;grunt serve;
```

The app will be automatically launched in your browser of choice.
Select a bus/metro line and hit submit to receive crowd load for each stop.
